# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Project Ready for GitHub! ðŸš€

Your credit card fraud detection project has been cleaned and prepared for GitHub upload. All author references have been removed and the code is now ready for your own repository.

## Files Included:

### Core Project Files:
- `CreditCardFraud.py` - Main machine learning script
- `download_dataset.py` - Dataset checker and helper
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `creditcard.csv` - Sample dataset (199 records)

### Documentation:
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `HOW_TO_RUN.md` - Quick start guide
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - This file

### GitHub Files:
- `.gitignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from version control
- `LICENSE` - MIT License for open source use

## Steps to Upload to GitHub:

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Credit Card Fraud Detection Project"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
3. Copy the repository URL

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Optional: Remove Sample Dataset

If you don't want to include the sample dataset in your repository:

1. **Uncomment the line in `.gitignore`:**
   ```
   creditcard.csv
   ```

2. **Or delete the file:**
   ```bash
   git rm creditcard.csv
   git commit -m "Remove sample dataset"
   ```

## Repository Description Suggestion:

```
